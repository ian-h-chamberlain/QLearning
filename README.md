# QLearning

To run, simply compile and run QLearningMain. What has been implemented is the basic q-learning algorithm, map generation (save and load), and a simple map visualization.

Still left to implement: a proper policy (right now it's just random), a path visualization and some way of viewing the results (q-values and policy-driven path) at the end of the episodes.
